# Sapoto.net - the social support network

The idea for a forum based troubleshooting network, with classifications for suggestions that would be voted on via the [Votecube](https://github.com/past-the-war-earth/votecube.com) widget, with outcomes weighted based on user experience and reputation.

It it's potential will be fully utilized after the release of Phase 3 of the NLNM simulation, as the data basis for eventual Thought Dialog engine, which itself is first and most needed for collective, rules based augmentative enforcement of NLNM rules. To accomplish that goal Sapoto Network will be used to record all significant per-unit events and simulation participant interactions starting in Phase 1.
