# Sapoto.net - the social support network

The idea for a forum based troubleshooting network, with classifications for suggestions that would be voted on via the [Votecube](https://github.com/past-the-war-earth/votecube.com) widget, with outcomes weighted based on user experience and reputation.

It it's potential will be fully utilized after the release of Phase 3 of the NLNM simulation, as the data basis for eventual Thought Dialog engine, which itself is first and most needed for collective, rules based augmentative enforcement of [NLNM rules](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/NLNM-combat-simulation/issues/1). To accomplish that goal Sapoto Network will be used to record all significant per-unit events and simulation participant interactions starting in Phase 1.

An important feature of Sappoto is the multidimensional nature of the threads and compostable thread boundaries. This will be first utilized in Phase 2 with real time limiting drone overhead event reporting at 2 levels below the unit command, and review time 2 levels up limit, with a (hardware enforced in the final military setting) hard upper limit at battalion headquarters, to take away any mental possibility of loss of focus. This will be the basis of Thought Dialog hierarchically compartmentalized, multi-level  collaborative, rules based thought progressions.
